The dataset is composed by the columns (EIN, APPLICATION_TYPE, AFFOLIATION, CLASSIFICATION, USER_CASE, ORGANIZATION, STATUS, INCOME_AMT, SPECIAL_CONDIERATIONS, ASK_AMT, and IS_SUCCESSFUL).

• Total budget and total students will decide the per student budget and school size
• per student budget will tend to have more resources
• average math score will represent the math level of the school
•	average reading score will represent the reading level of the school
•	percentage of passing math will change if the original data change
•	percentage of passing reading will change if the original data change
•	percentage of overall passing will change if the original data change


# Summary

• the data missing will not influce the math score
• the data missing will not influce the reading score
• the data missing will not influce the percentage passing math
• the data missing will not influce the percentage reading math
